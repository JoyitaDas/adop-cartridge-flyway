# What is Cartridge?

A [Cartridge](http://accenture.github.io/adop-docker-compose/docs/operating/cartridges/) is a set of resources that are loaded into the Platform for a particular [ADOP](http://accenture.github.io/adop-docker-compose/) 	 project. They may contain anything from a simple reference implementation for a technology to a set of best practice examples for building, deploying, and managing a technology stack that can be used by a project.

This cartridge consists of source code repositories and jenkins jobs for getting started with [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) and should help people get into DB migrations for Relational Databases.

## Source code repositories

Cartrige loads a repo containing some example SQL.

## Jenkins Jobs

This cartridge generates jenkins jobs to demonstrate a DB deployment using [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)
